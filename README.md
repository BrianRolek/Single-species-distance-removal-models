# Single-species-distance-removal-models
This repository contains files and data to run analyses for Rolek, B.W., D.J. Harrison, D.W. Linden, C.S. Loftin, P.B. Wood. 202X. Associations between breeding conifer-associated birds, forestry treatments, years-since-harvest, and vegetation in regenerating stands.

R scripts include abundance models with detection probabilities from distance and time-removal sampling for avian point counts. We use R as an interface to implement models in Just Another Gibb's Sampler (JAGs).
